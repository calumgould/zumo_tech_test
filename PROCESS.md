# Process

- Read the brief and looked at the [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) usage guide.

- Created a quick colour scheme and font pairing
    - Primary ![#faedf4](https://via.placeholder.com/15/faedf4/000000?text=+) `#f03c15`
    - Secondary ![#d0609b](https://via.placeholder.com/15/d0609b/000000?text=+) `#d0609b`
    - Accent ![#e56a82](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e56a82/000000?text=+) `#e56a82`
    - Background ![#212121](https://via.placeholder.com/15/212121/000000?text=+) `#212121`
    - Avocado Sans (Thin, Regular and Bold)

- Created React application and added the initial file structure.

- Fetched data from the API and viewed it in the console to see what format I was working with.

- Used the API to create an array of available currency symbols to populate the dropdown with.

- Made the API fetch request dynamic based on what currency was selected from the dropdown.

- Did basic styling once the list was being populated with the basic conversion rates.

- Ordered dropdown and results list alphabetically to make them easier to navigate.
